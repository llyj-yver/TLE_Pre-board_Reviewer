"84. Which rattan grade is typically the highest, indicating no blemishes and a uniform color?",Grade C,Grade A,Rejects,Unwashed,Grade C has significant blemishes and color irregularities.,"Grade A rattan is the premium export quality, free from scars and uniform in diameter.",Rejects are materials that cannot be used for standard production.,"Unwashed refers to the processing state, not necessarily the quality grade.",B

89. A crochet pattern requires a stitch that is taller than a Double Crochet. Which technical execution correctly describes the Treble Crochet?,"Yarn over once, insert hook, and pull through all three loops at once.","Yarn over twice, insert hook, and pull through two loops three times.",Insert hook into the stitch without a yarn over and pull through both loops.,Yarn over three times and pull through all loops in a single motion.,This describes a Half Double Crochet.,"A Treble Crochet is defined by two yarn overs at the start, creating a taller post by pulling through loops in three stages.",This describes a Single Crochet.,"Yarn over three times would be a Double Treble, and pulling through all loops at once would not create the necessary height.",B
"90. In the post-processing of Rattan, what is the primary purpose of using a Hydrogen Peroxide solution?",To soften the rattan poles so they can be bent into furniture frames.,To act as a powerful adhesive when joining two rattan stems together.,To seal the pores of the rattan to make it completely waterproof for outdoor use.,"To bleach the material to achieve a uniform, natural-white appearance.","Softening for bending is achieved through heat (steam or blowtorch), not chemical bleaching agents.",Hydrogen peroxide is an oxidizer and has no adhesive properties.,"Sealing is done with lacquer, varnish, or wax during the finishing stage.",Bleaching is a standard industrial step to remove natural stains and create the uniform light color expected in export-quality rattan.,D
